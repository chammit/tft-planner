# tft-planner

Initially, TFT Planner will be extremely rudimentary and lacking in functionality since I started building it to take a break from my primary project (League Metrics).  Hopefully, I will be able to add all of the features I would like in a reasonable amount of time so the app can actually be usable.

Next on my todo list for TFT planner is to clean up the existing logic around the board and champion list display so you can at least freely move champions around the board.  Then, I will look to incorporate traits to be displayed for each champion as well as adding the ability to sort/organize the main champion list by trait.  Additionally, I will look to add a trait tracker display next to the board similar to the one found in the TFT client.
